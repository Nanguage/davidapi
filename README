A simple library that uses the DAVID API (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/)
to retrieve functional annotations for a gene list. This could be expanded 
to make use of many of the other DAVID tools, and contributions are welcomed.


Usage is pretty simple:

---------------------------

require 'davidapi'

#create an array of gene symbols
geneList = ['ERBB2','TP53','MDM2']

#retrieve DAVID annotations
newHash = getFuncAnnotations(geneList)

#find annotations common to all genes in your list
common = getCommonAnnos(newHash)
